# Pandas tutorial

Learn how to use pandas to clean and explore tabular data.  Use Binder or Colab to get access to the Jupyter notebook and an environment with all necessary software installed.  No local installations or command line proficiency required.

Practice with pandas in JupyterLab on [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bballew/pandas_tutorial/master?urlpath=lab) or in [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bballew/pandas_tutorial/blob/master/Data_science_workshop_blank.ipynb)

Note that this is Part 2 of a two-part workshop.  Please see [this tutorial](https://github.com/subhacom/np_tut_breastcancer) for Part 1, which covers the basics of Jupyter Notebooks, numpy, and matplotlib.
